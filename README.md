This is Alexsploit, i made it because i got bored of exploits not working.

-- Mit license

-- Uses forlorn

-- Inspired by Mirko king's bytebreaker

-- Scripted in C# (CSharp)

-- 100% safe.

-- May get detected but it's fake, it gets detected because; it can close roblox (Killroblox option), change the games behaviour, attach to roblox. (but all that is safe, don't worry)
